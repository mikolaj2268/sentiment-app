5522193337,5,2014-01-06,"Originally I went into Sephora to get the Take the Day Off Cleansing Oil, but my store didn’t have it so I left with this instead. I’m so happy I did! This stuff is amazing. It feels great on the skin, and doesn’t dry me out at all (which is a huge plus in the wintertime). It gets rid of all of my makeup, including whatever eye makeup I wasn’t able to get rid of with my eye makeup remover (currently Philosophy’s). I’m going to continue to buy this for as long as I can. For anyone wondering, I do follow it up with an actual cleanser because I am prone to breakouts. This method works wonders for me. If you’re on the fence about this product and you have acne prone, dehydrated skin, go for it! It’s my favorite way to remove makeup.",P126301

8139884069,5,2022-04-26,"I am so happy to have found this product! I have struggled with acne, all my life, and nothing worked for me... I even broke down and put the dent in my wallet to buy proactiv just because I was so desperate for something to work. I found this product, after hearing about this brand by someone I watch on youtube, and I was amazed with how cheap it was... then I stayed to use it and I fell in love and almost cried when I saw the difference it started to make. This cleanser and the omega water cream lotion (from the same brand) is absolutely amazing together.",P443833
10470987299,5,2017-09-10,"it has a great natural citrus smell that is not over powering. it works great at exfoliating dead skin, left over make, & oil. also minimizes forehead & nose pores!",P386197
28055175704,3,2020-12-09,"Wonderful exfoliant! I have super sensitive and sensitized skin, so this is almost as rough as I can handle of an exfoliant on my cheeks and forehead. I use this once a week, and my hand or the pre-cleanse balm mitt for the rest of the week. The only down-side is that it seems to lose it’s grit rather easily once water is applied, and that might take a bit to get used to for someone used to more mechanical exfoliants. The smell and texture is great, and though I only bought the Mini bottle, it’s still lasted longer than a month so far and it’s not even close to empty~!!",P423688
1577347171,4,2020-04-24,"It smells like used old  frying oil (so there goes the star) but other than that very good makeup remover, I prefer oil based markup removers this isn’t thick or heavy when you apply it to you face!! Side note to Clinique PLEASE DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE SMELL",P126301
2477693687,5,2012-10-03,"I love this cream! It smells amazing, but the scent isn’t at all overwhelming! I have sensitive skin, and it didn’t bother me at all. You don’t have to use much either, so it’ll last a long time. It is definitely worth it. I just started using it, so I don’t know what it does long term, but it made my skin look and feel really nice after just one use! I will buy this again when I run out.",P434360

6868243823,5,2023-03-05,This sunscreen is so perfect under makeup. It adds the perfect glow that’s subtle and doesn’t make me look oily. It is so lightweight and does not leave a white cast. I have even worn it on it’s own and it makes my skin look so healthy,P456218
2464074537,2,2020-11-12,I have dry skin and I find this product does not provide enough moisture for my skin- almost makes my face feel tight after using it. I did notice my pores were smaller though. Would not recommend if you have dry skin!,P454794

1549708253,5,2009-04-16,This stuff works in terms of hydration and is not oily. Would not use on oily skin. If you travel a lot like me it’s a great post flight pick me up. It also works wonders (don’t know why or how) to get rid of puffiness. Had a wedding after an 18hr of flying. Arrived at night and work up with my eyes swollen shut the day of the wedding put the mask on for 45 min I was good to go.,P12336
11391470628,3,2019-06-11,This mask is great if you have a special event but it is not a long term product. It will temporarily clear my pores but then they just go back to normal a few hours later.,P297524
11111128334,5,2019-08-06,In love with this facial mask!❤️ My pores have never been so small along with my skin looking so bright!

2727933024,5,2021-12-28,"I fell in love with this cream the first time I used it. The pearlescent color of it and the light fragrance of it was a good first impression followed by the creamiest consistency when putting it on. Most of my moisturizer creams are of a watery, thin nature but this goes on so well and holds it “moisturized” feel for hours. It made my skin feel so soft and plump, I even used it on my neck. I feel, after using it twice a day for a week now, that it has dramatically reduced my fine lines and wrinkles on my face.",P481084

8069934257,2,2021-10-03,"So I bought this because of all the hype and because I wanted to add something to my skin care ritual at night for my lips. I figured im taking care of every other part so I deff need to include my lips. I have received a a sample of the berry flavor and bought the gummy bear during a sale. So I do like this product don’t get me wrong but its not worth he money. I have used this not only when I got to bed but in the AM and sometimes even during the day. I notice nothing other then my lips aren’t chapped. And while thats great I can get the same effect with Burts Bees or some other chapstick brand. This almost reminds me lipsmackers but for adults and extra hype. I feel like your lips must be sandpaper , desert dry and cracked for anyone to notice a healing or moistening benefit. I would only get another product of this brand if it was a sample or gifted to me. Not worth it , I am sorry.",P420652
33128379622,5,2022-02-03,This is great for acne prone skin where skin texture becomes uneven and if you have larger pore. I use in combination with an oil-based rose serum for day use and my skin maintains a neutral oil content all day. This serum is especially great owing to how light it is and how smooth it goes on.,P447592

2153771949,5,2018-05-04,"I am all about lightweight and hardworking moisturizers. While I haven’t tried too many gel creams, this one is more like a moisturizer that seems to pack a bigger punch. It’s got a refreshing scent and doesn’t bother my sensitive skin. Not sure how much “brightening” it’s helped with but overall very good daily product",P430337
23126813917,3,2019-12-08,I love the smell and the way it feels on my skin but this cleanser is so drying. If you have really dry skin and live in places below -20 this probably isn’t the best cleanser. I really wanted to love this product since I spent so much on it but I ended up spending more on a hydrating moisturizer.,P504615
8770458469,3,2022-11-24,I bought this cleansing balm to see if it would be a good dupe for the Clinique take the day off balm. It did a nice job removing makeup but felt goopy and didn’t dissolve well. The style of product delivery via tube is wasteful. I thought I finished it but cut it open and there was tons of product left. The biggest plus was that it’s gentle and didn’t make my face feel dry after. If you don’t want to spend tons of money this is a good option but it definitely does not match Clinique’s cleansing balm.,P455364
22794131116,5,2019-08-15,"I love everything about this product. It softens my lips, smells deliciously, and isn’t sticky at all. I’d purchase again if I’m out of this one.",P421243

1797554577,5,2015-10-16,These wipes are awesome. In my early 20’s I was only using philosophy’s microdermabrasion daily wash and have recently decided I needed something a little bit stronger going forward.I bought these wipes and noticed a difference within three days. I was apprehensive to buy because of the price but they really work!! They got rid of these silly tiny bumps on my chin that have been pretty much permanent since I was very young! I am impressed with how smooth my skin is and I will continue to buy.,P269122
1599917009,5,2019-07-16,"YYYYYAAAAASSSSSS. That really sums this up. And I am SO picky about lip gloss. Smooth, tastes amazing and wears off evenly and nicely.",P443563
7478249525,5,2020-05-11,Such a gentle and hydrating toner! The watermelon scent smells delish and feels refreshing. I’m very dry so I apply this after I cleanse with the Josie Maran pineapple enzyme cleanser. It’s helped keep my pores tight but with a radiant finish to my complexion. The scent is not a fragrance so it will not bother your nose. I use it both morning/night and my face looks soft and feels smooth.,P458219
1442277464,5,2014-09-12,This is a great all purpose oil that can be used on any skin.I have dry fair skin and it was great. I use it at night and put another moisturizer over it. You can use it alone if that’s too much.My boyfriend has oily skin and I put it on him. It makes his skin look so young and fresh.I love patting it around my eyes.,P376726
1634784560,5,2021-01-13,"This sunscreen was such a pleasant surprise! I loved the almost serum-like texture of the product and it blended seamlessly on my face and neck. This sunscreen isn’t white or tinted which for me is perfect for days I’ll be inside. No white cast either which is always a win! The price tag of this product is steep, but worth it for how wonderful this sunscreen feels on your skin. I definitely recommend!",P456398

2480340923,5,2018-05-15,"I NEVER write reviews but if you also suffer from hyper-pigmentation then chances are you probably spend a majority of your time reading articles/watching videos labeled “how I removed my acne scars in 1 day!!!” A majority of your paycheck is probably also spent on skincare products that promise to give you flawless skin... but never do? Well if what I said above is true, your answer is two words: Good. Genes. Good Genes by Sunday Riley has completely transformed my skin and removed scars I’ve been trying to get rid of for 1+ years in the matter of a few weeks!!!! Love the product so much but make sure not to over use (which can be hard because the results are so shockingly fast and wonderful) but your skin will most likely become more irritated and worsen. Also, my skin is too sensitive for the Luna Oil, after a few tries it broke me out every time. I then gave it to my grandmother who has been using it for the past month and is absolutely head over heels. For about 40 years how she has been religiously using Clinique/Estee skincare only, but just called me to inform me so many people are telling her she looks years younger she’s never going back to another product again!",P402718
9552442290,5,2021-03-13,"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have been struggling with bad hormonal acne these past few months because i recently switched my methods of birth control. I thought I would just have to wait out the bad skin because it is hormonal, but I was wrong. I figured there wouldn’t be anything to lose by trying a new cleanser since my skin was already bad and I am so glad i did. I have super oily skin and it is also very sensitive, so i have a hard time finding a cleanser that actually cleans my skin without stripping it. This one works wonders. I am seeing progress every day in my skin and i get excited to use it morning and night because it somehow makes my skin so soft and feel so nice. I will definitely be sticking with this one for the next few years at least.",P504615

11924848417,5,2019-06-24,"First of all, I have never used a toner in my life. In that sense I really do not have anything to compare this product too. I had been eye balling this for awhile but never really thought I needed a toner for my skin. I started using this toner 2 days ago and have already noticed such amazing results. I love the tingle that you first feel on your face, and I love the smoothness you feel after using it. I feel like it really tightens your face without feeling harsh. It makes the perfect foundation to the rest of your nightly routine. Also, the bottle is a great size for the price! I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product.",P439061

I woke up with hydrating skin when I used it over night even and overall my skin never felt dry while I used it. I also liked the fact that the full size has a refill option. The cons: the smell, I actually really liked the smell and I am not a person who is against fragrance in general but I just found that anytime it got on my lips is was generally unpleasant.

It brought me back to memories of her skincare routine and her favorite moisturizer. (using this made me buy Jergens again lol).Going back to the moisturizer it’s infused with Ceramides that help the skin’s natural moisture barrier.

Also please use it on a dry skin because it absorb the bacteria more and stays on it without slipping off. And I only used this when I squeeze a white head or cystic acne popped out.

This #AllureBestofBeauty award winner is a pore-diminishing serum powered by 100 percent natural salicylic acid meant to address blackheads, pores, breakouts, blemishes and excess oil. The formula having one of the highest concentrations of natural salicylic acid, is an ultra-light yet potent gel serum. Which is also 100 percent fragrance-free, with a scent that comes from natural essential oils. So if you’re bothered by scents at all, no worries here. The salicylic acid clarified and flushed my pores while the antioxidant grape seed polyphenols protected my skin and prevented the oil inside my pores from oxidizing, (or turning black) thus preventing blackheads. I was pleased to see one of my favorite ingredients on the ingredient list: rosewater! It truly enhanced my glow and hydrated my skin. I applied it all over my face in the morning after my shower and at night; though it may also be used as a spot treatment for problem areas. The essential oils provide antiseptic benefits to calm my skin and keep it clear, smooth and soft. Overall i enjoyed this serum and i look forward to purchasing more Caudalie products in the future. #vinopuresolution #contest #complimentary @mycaudalie @caudalie @InfluensterI received this product complementary from influencer for testing purposes",P474938

They mostly came off when I gently wiped it with my finger but it still bothers me that I cant rub in the sunscreen for fear of it pilling in the dry areas. I do think that its not clogging and didn’t cause any irritation and it does make my skin soft. So if you don’t mind having to deal with minor pilling in the dry areas of your face then going for this product is fine.

6922582133,5,2023-03-13,"I needed to write a review on this product because i feel a lot of the bad reviews are people who aren’t using/applying it well. This product has been a game changer for me so once you master this product, you’ll keep buying it. Growing up I never really got much sleep or drank enough water so my biggest concern was the bags under my eyes and two wrinkles forming. I’ve tried so many eye products, and I really thought none would be able to completely get rid of my bags, until I tried this one! It is so hydrating, my skin loves it and my under eye looks plump and so healthy and it stays like that all day. If I don’t use this Kiehl’s product, I noticed my bags immediately. It’s crazy how much of a difference this product makes! I’m in my early 30s and my older sister raved about it, which is what made me buy it, and I’m now on my second tub. Tips for using this product: First off, buy the smaller .05 fl oz size. It’s thick and a little bit goes a longgg way. My first purchase was the larger size,  only used it in the morning and it lasted around 1.5- 2 yrs. However, it did start to separate after awhile so I’d used a little spatula from a previous product to mix it when this happened and the product was just as effective.  Since it’s thick, it doesn’t apply as easy as lighter eye creams. You can’t just smear it under your eye or it will tug at the skin and not spread as far. For application I either put three little dots under my eye and tap it in that way or warm it up between my fingers and then tap it under my eye to apply it. Yes, it takes a little getting used to, but the results are unmatched. Previously, I’ve used both YTP eye creams, ole Heinekens, glow recipe retinol, Estée Lauder advanced repair, and none beat this Kiehl’s product. I’m not even a huge fan of Kiehls, this is their only product that I’ve purchased and will continue to purchase. Ofncourse it’d be nice if it was easier to apply and not separate but the results are amazing so 10/10 recommend.",P422000

Even more, I am finding that I am not getting a clean face (I use eye makeup remover beforehand and this is STILL not getting my mascara clean).  Any sort of sunscreen sticks around, too.  For the price, I should be getting a squeaky clean face with no issues.  I’m sad now - this isn’t the one.",P426836

My skin is noticeably brighter and smoother in the mornings. I haven’t seen a change in pore size yet, but it hasn’t yet been 2 weeks so I’ll wait to reserve judgement on that claim.

7868529688,4,2021-07-24,"The Superfood Cleanser was my first introduction to the brand Youth to the People. This cleanser is considered a cult favorite amongst skincare junkies and I was incredibly excited to be able to try it out for myself. As the name would suggest, this cleanser is jam packed with a bunch of “superfood” extracts including kale, spinach, green tea, alfalfa, vitamins C, E, and K. This cleanser has a thick gel consistency and doesn’t foam up too much. While the upfront cost of the cleanser is quite pricey at $36, the cost per oz isn’t that bad at $4. Since this cleanser is more so marketed for those with oily/combo skin, I was concerned it might be too stripping for my extremely dry skin; however, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this cleanser worked for me! It thoroughly cleanses my skin without leaving my skin feeling tight and squeaky clean. This is probably the “strongest” cleanser that I can use without making my skin overly stripped. I like to use this on days when my skin is feeling a bit oilier or more congested than usual or when I’m wearing a lot of makeup to ensure that my face is completely clean.

I had to use a good bit just to get the soothing effect that I wanted. I like more of a moisturizing top of primer. I will stick to my primerizer from Smashbox because it goes a longer way and it is in a pump bottle that way it does not break down over time. I gave it to stars because it was not a bad product it’s just that I have tried a lot of different primers that I have loved way more than this one and a lot of them cost a lot less. It was $20 just for this sample size that I could think I could use up in less than a month. I want to say it might last two weeks.

6317834539,3,2019-12-18,"When I first got this product, I loved it. I have extremely dry skin on my face. No drugstore face lotion has worked for me and I’ve resorted to using extremely thick CBD creams, so when I got this lotion as a sample and it worked for my dry skin, I was excited. I read these reviews before purchasing the full size, and I saw many comments about little bumps. This is what I experienced, in addition to bigger breakouts. I had small bumps all over my face while using this lotion. I stopped using it, and within 3 days the bumps went away and my breakouts started clearing. The bumps started about 3 weeks after using it, and I continued to use it for 2 months with hopes that my skin just had to adjust. It just kept getting worse, so I decided to stop the use all together. I didn’t notice any changes in fine lines, but maybe I didn’t use it long enough to see any results. All in all, it works great for dry skin, but the tiny bumps all over my face and continued breakouts wasn’t worth it for me.",P427421
2090223392,4,2020-02-20,"The product is actually incredible. I’m just extremely disappointed with the smell. It reminds me of cherry cough medication, you’d think it made with Greek yogurt would have some other smell, to me it’s extremely off putting. It’s similar to a mousse/ face cream, and blends in well. I have sensitive skin and haven’t had a reaction yet.",P456207

6756574571,3,2017-07-25,I spent 100 BI points getting the deluxe sample to try only to be so disappointed in how tiny it was. I understand it’s a sample but it’s not worth 100 pts that’s for sure. Perhaps if it was a more expensive moisturizer it be worth the 100 pts. It’s a decent moisturizer nothing makes it crazy special however if I’m going to spend $40 on moisturizer I’m gunna get a better brand.

This was a very gentle exfoliant which is hard to come by.

When i first used it, I immediately noticed that it was much easier to apply then other serums that I’ve used; it’s much thinner. I have acne prone skin and was worried that it would make me break out, but wasn’t the case. Just the opposite actually. It’s immensely hydrating! It certainly feels luxurious <3 I’d give the product a 5/5 but I’m giving it 4/5 for one reason only. Here’s why: when I saw that it was ‘clean’ I would not have expected such a strong scent —it does not bother me a bunch, but if you are adverse to scent, this is NOT the product for you.

To say it was incredibly successful is an understatement! (See my previous review on Influenster for the high-end brand with photos)  I was well prepared to shell out a large sum of money to repurchase said high-end brand but was happily surprised to have been chosen to receive a sample size of the Clinique Smart Clinical Repair Serum from #Influenster.  While the price point is less than the previous serum I tested, it is in the mid-high range, but being from a trusted and established company like Clinique, I believe it to be a fair price point.  After a few weeks of testing the product, I find that it helped to maintain the improvements from my previous serum, such as diminishing fine lines and wrinkles from around my eyes, lips, and forehead, keeping my skin looking moisturized, plump, and smooth from the boost of natural collagen, retinoid and hyaluronic acid.  It dries down quickly and leaves no sticky feeling on the skin.
