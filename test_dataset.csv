371886,371886,25993511362,2,2021-02-23,I really wanted to like this line but ended up making my skin oilier and irritated. My skin was extremely oily after a few hours of washing and applying the drops. I also got the cleanser and moisturizer so it could have been a combination of all the products. I do love the smell and how it feels as I applied it on my face. I didn’t help my already oily and sensitive skin.,P466123
105658,105658,1715672734,5,2009-10-18,Rosebud is the only line of lip balm that actually moisturizes and conditions my lips when they’re really dry. I’ve tried lots of pharmacy brands as well as Kiehls other higher end lip balms and this one is the best. The only downside is it doesn’t smell amazing.,P42204
74993,74993,7868529688,4,2021-07-24,"The Superfood Cleanser was my first introduction to the brand Youth to the People. This cleanser is considered a cult favorite amongst skincare junkies and I was incredibly excited to be able to try it out for myself. As the name would suggest, this cleanser is jam packed with a bunch of “superfood” extracts including kale, spinach, green tea, alfalfa, vitamins C, E, and K. This cleanser has a thick gel consistency and doesn’t foam up too much. While the upfront cost of the cleanser is quite pricey at $36, the cost per oz isn’t that bad at $4. Since this cleanser is more so marketed for those with oily/combo skin, I was concerned it might be too stripping for my extremely dry skin; however, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this cleanser worked for me! It thoroughly cleanses my skin without leaving my skin feeling tight and squeaky clean. This is probably the “strongest” cleanser that I can use without making my skin overly stripped. I like to use this on days when my skin is feeling a bit oilier or more congested than usual or when I’m wearing a lot of makeup to ensure that my face is completely clean. I’m a big fan of the Superfood Cleanser!!",P411387

169130,169130,1325110922,4,2017-09-06,"This cream is so, so good - it’s a gel type of consistency and is lightweight, great for morning or night. The cream is cool to the touch - think a subtle mint-like cooling agent for your face - and smells so good. If you have very dry skin I would not recommend, as the cream is fairly lightweight and won’t moisturize the way heavier, thicker creams would. I struggle with some dryness (depending on the weather) and some hormonal acne, but this product has definitely helped with both. Although I love it, I am beginning to look around for similar products at a lower price point - I’ve used this product for about half a year or so now but I’ve gone through nearly two jars. While that’s not an abnormal pace, $68 for this product size is slightly steep!",P454794

It’s light and creaming and does seem to melt into the skin. I personally haven’t noticed any difference in my eyes since using this product. To be fair, products like this should be used consistently for at least a month to notice any differences. Also, I am only 29 and I don’t really have wrinkles or bags under my eyes so this is another reason I haven’t noticed any results. I am hopeful that with continued use this product will help me prevent any wrinkles or bags in the future. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.",P447780

I purposely used the products at different times to see what was truly effective. the other products did make me glow and my skin more radiant, but this did nothing.

I think this pale bright yellow is an adorable accent to my bathroom countertop and it is a good sized bottle.  Now I tried this product a few times in order to accurately review it. My first thought on squeezing some out is that even though the product has pineapple and papaya enzymes, there is no overbearing fruity smell (which is honestly what I was expecting). There is a hint of a fruity smell that I found pleasant.  I have used AHA and BHA products before and upon applying have felt a tingling senesation that I didn’t really get with this product.  Not sure if that is because it is maybe a lower concentration of the product or if because normally the products I have used with these ingredients were meant to stay on the face for a few minutes before being washed off.  This product is an apply and wash off immediately.  That said, I though the exfoliating aspect of it was great!  Just that little bit of graininess to give you a bit of a scrub but not feel like you are scratching your face (like some scrubs do).  It was extremely gentle to use and I had no irritation afterwards.  My one downside is I haven’t seen any dramatic improvement, however this is a type of product that needs repeated use to see effect, so maybe I just haven’t reached that point yet.  But I would recommend to others to give it a try!",P455676

Lately it is really hard to find and I was sure nothing was going to work. Sephora at the Mall of America had this salve and when I tried it I became an immediate fan. Seems like it has been around since the 1800’s and now I see why. The only drawback it that it is not in “tube“ form but to me, that is fine.There is a slight smell to the salve itself but there is no taste associated with it. Not offensive in any way. Try it if you are undecided and like me, cannot find what you usually use. This is far better than Clinique’s super balm, Burt’s Bees products, and Keihl’s to name a few.",P42204

I have acne prone, oily skin but have switched from using all the crap designed for oily skin to actually giving it the moisture it needs and it’s made all the difference in the world!! I agree with the reviews that this can pill up, but I find that only happens if I use too much or in conjunction with other primers (mostly with pore filling ones).

They mostly came off when I gently wiped it with my finger but it still bothers me that I cant rub in the sunscreen for fear of it pilling in the dry areas.

Just  make sure to put the product in ur hands and then pat it on to your face light until it absorbs to hopefully cancel out any pilling.,P470255

I’ve been using this cream for a while and I’ve seen some great results over time. I use in the morning and night. At first I noticed how hydrated and smooth my skin looked and felt.

This #AllureBestofBeauty award winner is a pore-diminishing serum powered by 100 percent natural salicylic acid meant to address blackheads, pores, breakouts, blemishes and excess oil. The formula having one of the highest concentrations of natural salicylic acid, is an ultra-light yet potent gel serum. Which is also 100 percent fragrance-free, with a scent that comes from natural essential oils. So if you’re bothered by scents at all, no worries here. The salicylic acid clarified and flushed my pores while the antioxidant grape seed polyphenols protected my skin and prevented the oil inside my pores from oxidizing, (or turning black) thus preventing blackheads. I was pleased to see one of my favorite ingredients on the ingredient list: rosewater! It truly enhanced my glow and hydrated my skin. I applied it all over my face in the morning after my shower and at night; though it may also be used as a spot treatment for problem areas. The essential oils provide antiseptic benefits to calm my skin and keep it clear, smooth and soft. Overall i enjoyed this serum and i look forward to purchasing more Caudalie products in the future. #vinopuresolution #contest #complimentary @mycaudalie @caudalie @InfluensterI received this product complementary from influencer for testing purposes",P474938

I went from using it as a masque to applying a very thing layer---more as a spot treatment overnight. The eucalyptus burnt my eys and stung my skin when putting it on as a masque. In the end after a few weeeks of use....I noticed my skin was quite a bit dryer and still broken out. NOT GOOD!

It brought me back to memories of her skincare routine and her favorite moisturizer. (using this made me buy Jergens again lol).Going back to the moisturizer it’s infused with Ceramides that help the skin’s natural moisture barrier.

Waiting that long to use it I see the dead skin and gel that comes off but my face doesn’t get acne or irritated because in between sessions I use a gentler cleaner for every other day use.

I have very dry skin so that’s a major plus. A con is that I found that I have to use a lot of the product to get the results that I want.

This product has been a game changer for me so once you master this product, you’ll keep buying it. Growing up I never really got much sleep or drank enough water so my biggest concern was the bags under my eyes and two wrinkles forming. I’ve tried so many eye products, and I really thought none would be able to completely get rid of my bags, until I tried this one! It is so hydrating, my skin loves it and my under eye looks plump and so healthy and it stays like that all day. If I don’t use this Kiehl’s product, I noticed my bags immediately. It’s crazy how much of a difference this product makes! I’m in my early 30s and my older sister raved about it, which is what made me buy it, and I’m now on my second tub. Tips for using this product: First off, buy the smaller .05 fl oz size. It’s thick and a little bit goes a longgg way. My first purchase was the larger size,  only used it in the morning and it lasted around 1.5- 2 yrs. However, it did start to separate after awhile so I’d used a little spatula from a previous product to mix it when this happened and the product was just as effective.  Since it’s thick, it doesn’t apply as easy as lighter eye creams. You can’t just smear it under your eye or it will tug at the skin and not spread as far. For application I either put three little dots under my eye and tap it in that way or warm it up between my fingers and then tap it under my eye to apply it. Yes, it takes a little getting used to, but the results are unmatched. Previously, I’ve used both YTP eye creams, ole Heinekens, glow recipe retinol, Estée Lauder advanced repair, and none beat this Kiehl’s product. I’m not even a huge fan of Kiehls, this is their only product that I’ve purchased and will continue to purchase. Ofncourse it’d be nice if it was easier to apply and not separate but the results are amazing so 10/10 recommend.",P422000

I will say I have dry sensitive skin and it did feel very soothing and did not break me out and it does have a very subtle Citrus smell to it that I did enjoy but I just don’t think it’s worth the price. I had to use a good bit just to get the soothing effect that I wanted. I like more of a moisturizing top of primer. I will stick to my primerizer from Smashbox because it goes a longer way and it is in a pump bottle that way it does not break down over time. I gave it to stars because it was not a bad product it’s just that I have tried a lot of different primers that I have loved way more than this one and a lot of them cost a lot less.

There are people who complain about this product because it’s too drying or because it’s not effective on severe acne - that’s exactly why I like it. It doesn’t eliminate my oiliness, but it definitely helps. Because my acne is mild and I’m a little older, traditional acne products with benzoyl peroxide, high concentrations of salicylic acid, or sulfur are overly irritating and overkill. This really helps keep my mild acne in check. I can’t tell if it’s made much of a difference in my melasma, but melasma is harder to treat than dark spots from the sun. Regardless, I’m on my second bottle, and buying a third.I haven’t had any problems with pilling. I find that I have good absorption applying only 3 drops right after washing my face or toner, and I give all my skin care a few minutes to soak in before makeup as it. Don’t use to much!Keep in mind also that you get what you pay for - Deciem keeps prices (and irritants!) down by omitting the texturizers, colorants, and fragrances that make a serum feel like a “luxury product.“ This does the job - but if you want a skincare experience, you should probably look elsewhere.",P427417

I’ve recently had some persistent acne marks (brown in color) that weren’t going away, and my pores have always been enlarged (I have combination skin with an oily t-zone). This faded my marks within a few weeks! I only use it once or twice a week and spread a thin, even layer all over my face. I only use about a quarter-sized amount per application. It stings very slightly, but for me, AHA/BHA has never really bothered me. If you want baby soft skin that is smooth and even in color I highly recommend!

I also suffer from the bane of blackheads and usually use a clay mask to keep them at bay.The first few days I used this oil at night, it just sat on my skin and did not feel anything like a dry oil and neither seemed to make a difference. So took a break for few days and started using it again. This time I broke out in a few places as expected since this happens every time I use any Salicylic Acid based products. I persisted and eventually noticed my breakouts dried out and the oil was being absorbed much better than earlier. I decided to stop using other products I was using at night and just use this for a few days and it has made a big difference. My skin is brighter, smoother and black heads reduced but not completely gone. Around the same time, I got a sample of the Luna oil as well and it works like a dream with the UFO oil. Both of them have a strong herbal smell and it sticks around for a while. Personally, I prefer this to synthetic fragrances in my skin care products. It is really expensive but after using it for a month, I have barely made a dent and it will easily last me 6 more months and I think it works out in the long term.

It melts into your skin like butter and you barely notice you put something on your skin. I say barely because I do feel refreshed afterwards. So far since arrival I’ve used this product day and night  a slight dab and a couple taps to refresh the eye area. I have normal to very dry skin. I also live in an apartment in the city so the air quality is horrible and that’s when my skin goes very dry. It has a fresh light scent, that doesn’t bother me at all I actually love it. But from arrival until now I have seen my under eye area smoother, more full, slightly less discoloration (I started to get dark circles so this is helping) overall I love the feeling and it feels well on my under eyes. And the packaging is beautiful that flower cap is stunning. Tatcha always does an amazing job. I’ve been able to put on my make up with no issues at all, it primes really well. Definitely recommend this 5/5. Let’s see what happens after a month of use. I do wish it was more affordable so everyone can try their amazing products. $60 is a hefty price point but if it continues doing what it’s supposed to I would say it’s worth it.

409891,409891,10213715199,4,2021-06-23,"I got this product complimentary from FarmacyBeauty in exchange for an honest review. The serum as the name suggests help you have the most amazing glow by provinding exfolianting  benefits overnight. I apply it at night and wake up to a smooth and bright looking skin. It doesn’t sting or dry out my sensitive and dry skin, which is huge for me when it comes to Aha’s and Bha’s. I would be recommending this product to everyone. Please make sure you wear SPF next day and everyday for the rest of your life!",P434548

It even seemed to be nicely mattifying, absorbed quickly, and provided a great base for makeup. The scent could be a little bit better, but overall I am very satisfied (though I will be keeping an eye out for a comparable product at a lower price point).",P381030
324848,324848,1653500817,1,2013-04-21,"The clarifying cleanser itself seems to be fine. My problem is the design of the container. The bottom lid does not close properly and when you stand it up, the tube leaks. Twice the container has leaked product all over my bathroom countertop. What a waste of $26!",P440651
